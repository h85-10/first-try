    <h2>XBOX ONE ET XBOX SERIES X / S</h2>
    <p>Game Pass is available on all models of Xbox One (original, S, X and S All Digital) as well as next-gen consoles, Xbox Series X and Series S. The service is very well integrated into the interface and can even be considered part of the general Xbox experience.</p>
    <h2>PC WINDOWS 10 ET 11</h2>
    <p>On Windows PC, you have to go through the Xbox application to access the Game Pass games. Where on console there is no need to wonder about the capacities of the machine to run a title, the question arises on computer. enabled that your configuration is powerful enough before installing a game. Note that the application is already preinstalled if you have a computer running Windows 11.</p>
    <h2> NAVIGATEURS, ANDROID, IOS</h2>
    <p>The Xbox Game Pass is also accessible from most web browsers via cloud gaming. Safari is supported, so bringing the service to iPhones and iPads. To date, it's the only way to enjoy Game Pass from Apple's ecosystem, which has blocked Microsoft from releasing an app on its App Store for "security reasons". Going through the browser is a way to circumvent this prohibition.
      On our Android devices, just download the Xbox Game Pass app from the Play Store. It is also possible to go through the browser, but the app has a better optimized UI and better performance. Still via xCloud, the Game Pass could also soon land natively on Android TV.</p>
